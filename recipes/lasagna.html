    <p></p>Lasagna, a classic of Italian cuisine, consists of alternating layers of pasta, flavorful tomato sauce, ground meat, and a generous béchamel sauce. The preparation begins with a savory filling: the meat, often a mix of beef and pork, is simmered with onions, garlic, aromatic herbs like basil and oregano, and a rich tomato sauce. Meanwhile, a creamy béchamel, made from butter, flour, and milk, is prepared to add smoothness and depth to the dish. The lasagna sheets, either pre-cooked or raw depending on the type, serve as the base for this delightful combination.
    <p></p>The lasagna is assembled directly in a baking dish. Layers of pasta, meat sauce, béchamel, and grated cheese—typically parmesan or mozzarella—are alternated until all the ingredients are used. The final layer is generously topped with cheese for a golden, crispy crust. Once assembled, the lasagna is baked until the flavors meld together and the top becomes beautifully gratinated. Served hot, it is best enjoyed with a fresh green salad for a comforting and well-balanced meal.
