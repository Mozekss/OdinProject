    <p></p>Couscous, a staple of North African cuisine, is a versatile dish made from steamed semolina grains. Often served as a base for hearty stews, it pairs beautifully with a medley of vegetables such as carrots, zucchini, and chickpeas, along with tender pieces of meat like lamb or chicken. Seasoned with aromatic spices like cumin, cinnamon, and turmeric, couscous embodies a perfect balance of flavors and textures. Quick to prepare and highly nutritious, it is enjoyed across the globe as a wholesome and satisfying meal. Whether served traditionally or with modern twists, couscous remains a symbol of communal dining and culinary heritage.
